Hello, and welcome to my GitHub pages where you can learn about my latest projects, and browse examples of my creative writing.

I currently serve as Treasurer and Webmaster for the Bee Sanctuary Movement, a Manchester-based charity focused on redeveloping green spaces to support bees and other pollinators. Our work also includes public education initiatives on bee conservation.

In terms of technical development, I recently completed the Introduction to Programming course offered by the University of Helsinki and am now enrolled in the follow-up Advanced Programming course. My current programming skills include Python, with experience in Tkinter and Qt for GUI development. I plan to expand my expertise into JavaScript, Full Stack Development, and AI tool creation using the ChatGPT API.

As a creative developer, I have written and published a text adventure game, Quest of the Mysteries, using the Inform 7 language, which is now available on IFDB.org. Additionally, I authored and self-published a novel with an occult theme, The Elder Agenda, available on Amazon.

Outside of work and study, I’m passionate about fitness and maintain a daily workout routine at my local gym. I’m also an avid listener of classical music, with subscriptions to Medici.tv, Amazon Music, and regular listening on BBC Sounds.

In the long term, I aim to either develop a fork of the open-source Accounting System project on GitHub to better support the needs of small charities, or continue expanding my creative work in interactive storytelling—potentially combining Unity with Ink to build narrative-driven games.
